# CS7648_Project
The aim of this project is to improve learning efficiency of the [Deep Tamer algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.10163v2.pdf) through the incorporation of an active learning acquisition function. We will utilize the [Minigrid](https://minigrid.farama.org/content/basic_usage/) environment to do this. First, we will obtain baselines of a human, RL agent, [TAMER](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4640845) agent, and Deep TAMER agent. Once we obtain 
those baselines, we will implement our own version of Deep TAMER + Active Learning to demonstrate it's success over all baselines. 

## Setup Instructions

1. `pip install minigrid`
2. (Optionally) git clone [rl-starter-files](https://github.com/lcswillems/rl-starter-files)
3. (Optionally) git clone torch-ac
